# DrumKIT

#Developed a dynamic and interactive drum kit application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Implemented event listeners to handle key press and mouse click events, mapping each drum element to unique audio files. Included functionality for corresponding keys to produce sounds when pressed, enhancing interaction.

#Utilized DOM manipulation to provide visual and auditory feedback when a drum is activated, improving user experience.

#Ensured responsiveness and cross-device compatibility through media queries and flexible layout design.

#Optimized performance by preloading audio assets and efficiently managing event handlers.
